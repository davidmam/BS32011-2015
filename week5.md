# Week 5

## Targets
* Identify a set of top candidate primer pairs and enzymes to perform the RFLP assay
* Ensure all code is documented and written up.

### Quality control
Primer3 may produce many 10's or even 100's of candidate primer pairs. For each restriction site that you are examining you will get many options. The way you need to assess these is as follows:

* Do the amplified fragments fall within the size range you want?
* Will the digest give a clear size change in the band (ie is it in the middle rather than right at an end)?
* Look at the primer sequences. 
  * Are they self complementary (this is bad)?
  * Are they specific? We'll discuss how to test this in a lab meeting.
  
 You may find that you have to go back and rethink your primer3 parameters and run that step again. That won't take long - it is the writing of all teh processing code that takes the time.
 
 By the end of the week you should have  a small number (no more than about half a dozen) of your best ranked differntial sites and a primer pair for each. Consider how best to optimise them *as a set* (think carefully about how easy it will be to use your recommendation to analyse a lot of samples).
 
 If you have managed to get through to the end with a good result, well done!
