# Week 4

## Targets
* Be able to run Primer3 to identify primers to amplify a region of interest
* Parse the output from primer3 into a tractable (usable) form.

### Comments
Most of this week has already been discussed previously. As you run Primer3 you will want to monitor the outputs. Are you able to get suitable primers with the conditions you select (ie Tm). Too high a Tm and you will find few suitable primers. Too low and you will get many primers, some of which may not be suitably specific. So you will have to think about and try different sets of parameters

The output from Primer3 is not immediately obvious/tractable. You should aim to generate a table of the different primers and so on that you can filter using appropriate criteria.

By the end of the week you should be ready to do some quality control and rank the list of candidates you have identified.
